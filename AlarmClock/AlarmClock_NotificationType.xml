    <!-- Note that setting Icon="NOTIFICATION_ICON_GENERIC" here doesn't do anything.
         GetIconName will still return "ICON_NOTIFICATION_ALARM_CLOCK". This means we
         could presumably add an icon with that name, but since it doesn't exist,
         "NOTIFICATION_ICON_GENERIC" is used, which is just fine by me. -->
